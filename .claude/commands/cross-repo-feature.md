# Cross-Repo Feature Implementation

Coordinates implementation of a feature that spans multiple repositories using discovered specialist subagents.

**Workflow:**
1. **Discovery**: Scan for available repositories and specialist subagents
2. **Analysis**: Break down feature requirements by repository
3. **Coordination**: Create Linear tasks with cross-repo dependencies
4. **Implementation**: Navigate between repos to delegate to specialists
5. **Integration**: Coordinate testing and deployment across repositories

**Usage:**
```
Implement cross-repo feature "[feature description]" with coordination
```

**Coordination Strategy:**
- Auto-discover available repositories and their specialist subagents
- Create integration tasks in Linear for cross-repo dependencies
- Navigate between repositories to delegate implementation tasks
- Coordinate API contracts and integration points
- Track progress through Linear project management

**Example:**
```
Implement cross-repo feature "Real-time notifications with AI sentiment analysis" with coordination
```

This will:
1. Discover backend, mobile, and AI repository specialists
2. Create coordinated Linear tasks for each repository
3. Navigate to each repo to delegate implementation
4. Coordinate integration testing and deployment
5. Track progress and handle dependencies through Linear
